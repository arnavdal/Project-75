  <p>Debate on Pollution: Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse changes to the environment. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat, or light. Pollutants or the components of pollution can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. According to research conducted it was discovered that more than 9 million are killed to date due to the ever-increasing pollution.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest soccer tournaments in the world, the Summer Games tournament is unique in that it features both a men’s and women’s competition. While the tournament dates way back to 1900 for the men, the women’s competition wasn’t introduced until 1996. With both winners decided in just over two weeks, it’s an action-packed tournament and lots of fun to watch. It’s also one of few sports at the Summer Games that allows guests to see events outside of the host city.</p>

   <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school Canteen Account on the schood website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

       1. Accuracy Huamns are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitabled and costly  errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performace and payroll data.
       <br>
       2. Economics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by Axsium Group found the large orginizations save up $1,600 per emplyee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
       <br>
       3. Productivity / Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and affort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
